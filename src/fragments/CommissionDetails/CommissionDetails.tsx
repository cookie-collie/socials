            Please try to refrain from using a shaded reference for the
            commission. If you do not have a reference of any kind, the artwork
            depicting your character visually must not be heavily shaded. I am
            not responsible for wrong color usage due to heavily shaded
            references.

            I only accept references in either PNG or JPEG format. Any
            references that do not conform to the format will be discarded.

            A draft will be sent to you before the lining and coloring process.

            hours after the draft is sent.

            reasonable about the frequency.

            After I send you the completed artwork, please make sure to check
            for any errors and details before confirming the final approval.
            Keep in mind that any errors made by me (e.g. Forget to color a
            part, patterns on the wrong side, missing accessories, â€¦) are not
            charged any fees.
